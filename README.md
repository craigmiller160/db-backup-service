# db-backup-service

An application to run and automatically backup data from databases in the Kubernetes environment.

## Overview

This application will run on a set interval and run `pg_dump` commands against the Postgres database, creating an archive of database backup files in a destination directory.

## Setting Up Development Environment

This requires `pg_dump` to be available on the host system. To install it, run this command:

```
sudo apt install -y postgresql-client
```

## Adding Databases/Schemas to Backup

There is a file, `backup_config_prod.json`, in the root of the resources directory. Update this with the database/schema names and re-release to include it in the backup.
